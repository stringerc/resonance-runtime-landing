# 🔧 Command Line Issue Fix

## The "cmdand cmdand cmdand quote>" Issue

This happens when there's an unclosed quote or special character in the command. The terminal gets stuck waiting for input.

## Solution

**For me (the AI):** I'll avoid complex bash commands with quotes and use Node.js scripts instead.

**For you:** If this happens in your terminal:
1. Press `Ctrl+C` to cancel
2. Press `Enter` a few times
3. Or type `exit` and open a new terminal

## What I'll Do Instead

Instead of complex bash commands, I'll:
- Use Node.js scripts (like `update-env.js`)
- Provide simple commands you can copy-paste
- Avoid nested quotes and complex escaping

This should prevent the stuck terminal issue.
