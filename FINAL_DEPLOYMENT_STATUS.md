# 🎯 Final Deployment Status

## ✅ COMPLETED

### Vercel Configuration (100% Complete)
1. ✅ **8 Environment Variables** added:
   - DATABASE_URL (encrypted)
   - NEXTAUTH_URL (https://resonance.syncscript.app)
   - NEXTAUTH_SECRET (encrypted)
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY (encrypted)
   - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY (encrypted)
   - STRIPE_RESONANCE_STARTER
   - STRIPE_RESONANCE_PRO
   - STRIPE_RESONANCE_ENTERPRISE

2. ✅ **Project Settings**:
   - Root directory: `webapp` ✅
   - Domain: `resonance.syncscript.app` ✅
   - Node version: 22.x ✅

### GitHub Upload (Started)
- ✅ `webapp/next.config.js` uploaded
- ✅ `webapp/package.json` uploaded
- 🔄 More files uploading...

## 📋 What's Next

I'm uploading the critical Next.js files to GitHub. Once the minimum files are uploaded:
- Vercel will auto-detect the push
- Start building your Next.js app
- Deploy to https://resonance.syncscript.app

## 🚀 Quick Test After Deployment

1. Visit: https://resonance.syncscript.app
2. Test database: https://resonance.syncscript.app/api/test-db
3. Sign up: https://resonance.syncscript.app/auth/signup
4. Sign in: https://resonance.syncscript.app/auth/signin

## ⚠️ Note

Since git command line isn't working, I'm using GitHub MCP tools to upload files. This is slower but will get the job done. The deployment is configured correctly - we just need to finish uploading the code files.

**Estimated time**: 5-10 minutes to upload critical files, then Vercel build takes ~2-3 minutes.

**Status**: ✅ Configuration Complete | 🔄 Uploading Files | ⏳ Waiting for Build
