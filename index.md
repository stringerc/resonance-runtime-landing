## Abstract

We propose *Resonance Calculus* (RC) and *Resonance Algebra*, a unified framework for modeling and optimizing the performance of large-scale discrete-event systems under coherence, timing, and tail constraints. RC combines (i) coherence-weighted service models that couple classical service curves with context-dependent alignment factors, (ii) tail-aware risk metrics derived from Extreme Value Theory (EVT) applied to rare high-impact events, and (iii) max-plus algebra for synchronization, cycle-time, and bottleneck analysis on networks of interdependent components. These ingredients yield scalar resonance scores and max-plus eigenvalues that can be used as control signals for routing, scheduling, and resource allocation.

We formulate resonance metrics, relate them to service curves and max-plus cycle times, and outline feedback laws that regulate resonance within prescribed bands under explicit SLO and safety constraints. The framework applies to cloud and edge computing, embedded and IoT controllers, fleet and operations systems, and hybrid quantum–classical workflows. We provide illustrative constructions and discuss how RC can be integrated with existing optimization and control stacks. Long-range speculative physics or propulsion concepts are deliberately excluded; we focus on mechanisms that are concretely implementable with current or near-term technology.
