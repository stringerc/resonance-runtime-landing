# Test User Credentials

## ✅ Test Account Created

A test user has been created in the database for testing sign-in functionality.

### Login Credentials:

- **Email:** `test@example.com`
- **Password:** `TestPassword123!`

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/auth/signin
2. Enter the email and password above
3. Click "Sign in"

---

## 📝 Note

The database connection from your local machine may have DNS issues, but the database is accessible via Supabase MCP. The test user was created directly in the database.

If you need to create more users, you can:
1. Use the sign-up page: http://localhost:3000/auth/signup
2. Or create users directly via Supabase MCP

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If sign-in still doesn't work:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Check the Next.js server logs for errors
3. Verify the database connection is working (it may take a moment to wake up)
